I’m a Software Engineer who has been doing software development & independent programming for a while. I also lead & manage projects end to end so I can help in more than one way. I prefer to develop application on independent ideas to innovate solutions.

Here are a few different ways I can help.

♨ As a Developer
- You need help leading a development team, or are looking for an independent contributor to help out with development.

♨ As a Project Manager
- You need help defining the product requirements, or want someone to work closely & as a liaison between the product owners & developers.

♨ As A Problem Solver
- You have a varying list of ever changing software engineering needs and need someone who can do a bit of everything!
